# 1. Background & Core Problem

Major social platforms (Meta, YouTube, TikTok, etc.) have allowed large-scale scam advertising for years.

These scams include:

- AI deepfake celebrity endorsements  
- Fake investment platforms  
- Fake banks & fake government alerts  
- Impersonated influencers  
- Ponzi-style “guaranteed return” schemes  

The core issue is not the scammers but:

> **Platforms fail to treat scam ads as systemic risks and profit from them.**

# 2. Why Scam Ads Are Exploding

### **A. Strict review reduces ad revenue**  
Scam advertisers pay extremely high CPC/CPM → platforms tolerate them.

### **B. Scam ads increase global CPC for all advertisers**  
Legitimate advertisers pay the price.

### **C. Review cost is high, incentive is low**  
Video review requires OCR + frame analysis + deepfake detection.

### **D. Scam ROI is extraordinarily high**  
One victim = $100K loss  
Ad spend = $50  
→ The highest ROI crime industry in the world.

# 3. Social & Financial Impact

### Individual impact:
- Life savings wiped out  
- Pension funds stolen  
- Severe psychological trauma  
- Elderly disproportionately targeted  

### Societal impact:
- Court & police overload  
- Increased bankruptcy  
- Collapse of financial trust

# 4. Industrialized Scam Ecosystem

### Organizational features:

- 24/7 global workflow  
- Militarized management  

### Regions involved:

- Laos special zones  
- Malaysia black zones  

### Human rights abuses include:

# 5. AI Deepfake Acceleration

AI enables scammers to:

- Clone celebrity faces  
- Clone voices  
- Auto-generate “interview” footage  
- Produce realistic financial recommendation videos  

Victims cannot tell real from fake.

Examples include fake versions of:
- Hong Kong finance YouTubers  
- Singapore & Taiwan influencers  
- US financial broadcasters  
- CEOs & political leaders  

> **AI will soon make scam ads indistinguishable from real content.**
